          OK, let's do it! This was on my mind the entire time, when RÄƒzvan was
          showing us the wealth of web development. I like to do things for a
          great purpose and I get my motivation from people's energy. I'm a
          fearless viking, searching for more, when it comes to conquering new
          territory on a web developer map. I can't wait to meet my ship's
          capitan and crew.
